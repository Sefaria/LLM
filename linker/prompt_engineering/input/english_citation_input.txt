Brachot 9b says if one missed the time for Kriyat Shema one can read it with Brachot. Rambam (Kriyat Shema 1:13), Rif (Brachot 9b), Bahag, Shiltei Giborim (Brachot 10b) in name of Smag, Ravyah 25 pg 14, Sefer Chinuch 420, Rid (Brachot 10b), and Riaz Brachot 1:1(7) hold that one can make the Brachot the entire day. However the Rosh Brachot 1:10 quotes Rav Hai Goan that one can only say the Brachot until the 4th hour. This is also the opinion of Rabbenu Chananel (Brachot 10b), Or Zaruha 1:16, Siddur Rav Sadyah Goan 13, Meiri (Brachot 10b), Ravan 139, Tur and Shulchan Aruch Orach Chaim 58:6. Most Achronim agree with Shulchan Aruch including Levush 58:6, Bach, Taz 58:4, Petach Dvir 2 pg 18a in name of Rav Chaim Vital, Shulchan Gavoha 58:12, Siddur Yavetz , Gra 58:15, Pri Megadim M”Z 58:4, Shulchan Aruch HaRav 58:10, Chaye Adam 21:3, Kaf HaChaim 58:25, and Halacha Brurah 58:14. However some argue on Shulchan Aruch allow one to say Brachot all day including Sh”t Radvaz 2:156, Pri Chadash 58:6, Rav Chaim Ben Atar in Rishon LeTzion (Brachot 10b), Sh”t Chaim Shal 2:38(70), Keshur Gudal 6:4, and Erech HaShulchan 58:3.
