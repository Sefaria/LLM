How so? When a Torah scholar enters the city, do not say: I don't need him. Instead, go to him. And do not sit next to him on a bed, or on a chair, or on a bench. Rather, sit before him on the ground, and accept upon yourself every word that comes from his mouth with fear and reverence, trembling and sweating, just as our forefathers accepted what they heard at Mount Sinai with fear and reverence, trembling and sweating. Another explanation: Become dirty in the dust of their feet : This refers to Rabbi Eliezer; And drink in their words thirstily : This refers to Rabbi Akiva. What were the origins of Rabbi Akiva? They say that he was forty years old and had still not learned anything. Once, he was standing at the mouth of a well and he said: Who carved a hole in this stone? They said to him: It is from the water, which constantly [falls] on it, day after day. And they said: Akiva, don't you know this from the verse (Job 14:19), ""Water erodes stones""? Rabbi Akiva immediately applied this, all the more so, to himself. He said: If something soft can carve something hard, then all the more so, the words of Torah, which are like steel, can engrave themselves on my heart, which is but flesh and blood. He immediately went to start studying Torah. He went with his son and they sat down by the schoolteachers. He said to one: Rabbi, teach me Torah! He then took hold of one end of the tablet, and his son took hold of the other end. The teacher wrote down aleph and beit for him, and he learned them ( aleph to tav , and he learned them; the book of Leviticus, and he learned it). And he went on studying until he learned the whole Torah. Then he went and sat before Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Joshua. My masters, he said, open up the sense of the Mishnah to me. When they told him one law, he went off and sat down to work it out for himself. (This aleph ‚Äì what was it written for? That beit ‚Äì what was it written for?) Why was this thing said? He kept coming back, and kept asking them, until he reduced his teachers to silence. Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar said: I will give you a parable to tell you what this was like: Like a stonecutter who was hacking away at the mountains. One time he took his pickaxe in his hand, and went and sat on top of the mountain, and began to chip small stones away from it. Some people came by and asked him: What are you doing? He said to them: I am going to uproot the mountain and throw it into the Jordan! They said to him: You cannot uproot the entire mountain! But he kept hacking away, until he came to a big boulder. So he wedged himself underneath it, pried it loose, and threw it into the Jordan. And he said to it: Your place is not here, but there! This is what Rabbi Akiva did to Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Tarfon. Rabbi Tarfon said to him: Akiva, it is about you that the verse says (Job 28:11), ""He stops up the streams so that hidden things may be brought to light."" For Rabbi Akiva has brought to light things which are kept hidden from human beings. Every day, he would bring a bundle of sticks, half of which he would sell to support himself and half he would use for kindling. His neighbors came and said to him: Akiva, you are choking us with all this smoke. Sell it all to us instead, and then buy oil with the money, and study by the light of a candle. He said to them: But I take care of many of my needs with it. I study [by its light]. I warm myself [by its fire]. And then I can [make it into a bed and] sleep on it. All the poor will one day be judged against Rabbi Akiva, for if one says to them: Why did you never study? [And they say: Because] we were poor! then we will say to them: But wasn't Rabbi Akiva even poorer, completely impoverished? [And if they say: It is because of our babies, we will say: But didn't Rabbi Akiva] have sons and daughters as well? (But they will say: It is because) he merited to have his wife Rachel [to help him]. He was forty years old when he went to study Torah, and after thirteen years, he was teaching Torah to the masses. It was said that he did not leave the world until he had tables full of silver and gold, and he could go up to his bed on golden ladders. His wife would go out in a fancy gown and with golden jewelry with an engraving of Jerusalem on it. His students said: Rabbi, you are embarrassing us with what you have done for her.

R. Samuel bar Nahman said: Before the destruction of the Sanctuary, the Divine Presence was situated in the Temple, as stated (Ps. 11:4): THE LORD IS IN HIS HOLY TEMPLE ; but, after the Temple was destroyed, (ibid. cont.:) THE LORD'S THRONE IS IN THE HEAVENS . He had removed his Divine Presence to the heavens. R. Eleazar ben Pedat said: Whether the Temple is destroyed or not destroyed, the Divine Presence has not moved from its place, as stated (in Ps. 11:4): THE LORD IS IN HIS HOLY TEMPLE . And where is it shown? Where it is stated (in I Kings 9:3): MY EYES AND MY HEART SHALL BE THERE FOR ALL TIME . It also says so (in Ps. 3:5 [4]): I RAISE MY VOICE UNTO THE LORD, AND HE ANSWERS ME FROM HIS HOLY HILL. SELAH . For even though it is &lt;only&gt; a hill, here he remains in his holiness. R. Eleazar ben Pedat said: See what is written (in Ezra 1:3): AND LET HIM BUILD THE HOUSE OF THE LORD GOD OF ISRAEL. HE IS THE GOD WHO IS IN JERUSALEM . He has not moved from there. R. Aha said: The Divine Presence has never moved from the West Wall (i.e., the Wailing Wall) of the Sanctuary. Thus it is stated (in Cant. 2:9): THERE HE STANDS BEHIND OUR WALL . Ergo (in Ps. 11:4): THE LORD IS IN HIS HOLY TEMPLE . R. Jannay said: Although they said (in Ps. 11:4): THE LORD IS IN HIS HOLY TEMPLE; THE LORD HAS HIS THRONE IN THE HEAVENS ; &lt; nevertheless &gt; (the verse continues), HIS EYES BEHOLD, HIS EYELIDS TEST THE CHILDREN OF ADAM . To what is the matter comparable? To a king who had an orchard and brought in the workers. Now by the orchard gate there was a certain storehouse full of everything good. The king said: Whoever does his work wholeheartedly will receive his reward from here, but whoever does not do his work wholeheartedly, him I shall return to my palace and judge. Who is this king? This is the Supreme King of Kings, the Holy One. And what is the garden? It is this world. Within it the Holy One has put the children of Adam so that they may observe the Torah. But he has made a stipulation with them and said to them: For everyone who truly observes the Torah, here is paradise &lt; lying &gt; before him; but for everyone who does not truly observe the Torah, here is Gehinnom &lt; lying &gt; before him. The Holy One said: Although I seemed to have removed my Divine Presence from the Sanctuary, still (in Ps. 11:4): MY EYES BEHOLD, &lt;MY EYELIDS TEST THE CHILDREN OF ADAM &gt;. Whom does he test? (According to vs. 5:) THE LORD TESTS THE RIGHTEOUS . And why does he not test the wicked? R. Jannay said: When the flax worker is pounding away and sees that the flax is good, he pounds it a lot; but, when he sees that it is not good, he does not pound on it, lest it be spoiled. Ergo (in Ps. 11:4:) HIS EYES BEHOLD, HIS EYELIDS TEST THE CHILDREN OF ADAM . [And whom does he test? The righteous, as stated (in vs. 5):] THE LORD TESTS THE RIGHTEOUS .",,

Rather which month has a new moon that is covered and has a festival, and its festival is on the day [of the new moon]? You only find this in the month of Tishrei. On this month, rejuvenate your deeds with the shofar; on this month, improve (shapru) your deeds.

And that is that a person sees himself as if his powers have already disappeared due to his sickness, or as if he has already died and has no hope. But behold he is purified by the breaking of his heart, like the matter of a clay vessel, which is purified by breaking it. So the Satan is no longer able to accuse [them of sins], since their impurity has removed itself from them. Yet there is nevertheless hope about them for the [Satan]. He is [however] a foolish old king, as he thinks that maybe because of their subjugation and the breaking of their heart they will fall into the pits of sadness, despair and black humor, as this is the worst of all. Hence he still makes efforts to bring piles of iniquities and to accuse, in order that this will cause sadness and despair to the Jewish people below, God forbid. However when he sees that they go back and blow the shofar while they are standing - that is, that they are aroused with new life and hold the commandments dear - then the hands of the Satan weaken and he loses all hope. So he is confused and no longer knows what to do. But he is afraid to continue bringing piles of sins and to accuse, lest from the accusation, the Jewish people will add to their arousal and their new life to the point that the [verse] will be fulfilled, ""If only My people would listen to Me, if Israel would follow My paths, then would I subdue their enemies at once, strike their foes again and again"" (Psalms 81:14-15).

But in their exodus, they were redeemed and separated out. And behold that until that time, all the aspects of people's bodies were darkened by overpowering darkness and pollution. But with the exodus, Israel was separated, and their bodies were prepared to become pure and to be ready for the Torah and for [divine] service. And it was for this function that they were commanded about the destruction of chamets and the eating of matsah. Indeed, this is because the bread that is prepared for human sustenance is truly equal to the desired state of man. As the matter of leavening is that it is a natural thing in bread, in order for it to be easily digestible and have a good taste. Behold this is also that which follows from the proper nature of man, as he also needs that the evil impulse and the penchant for the physical (equated with leavening) be in him. Yet for a specific and determined time, Israel needed to refrain from chamets and to be sustained by matsah, so as to diminish the strength of the evil impulse and the penchant for the physical in themselves, and to enhance their drawing near to spirituality. Yet it would be impossible for them to always be sustained like that, since this is not what is desired in this world. However it is fit that they should keep this matter during the days designated for it. For through this, they will maintain the level appropriate for them. And behold this is the main content of the Holiday of Matsot (Passover). And the other commandments of the first night are all specific matters parallel to the details of that redemption.",,

Afterwards take the bitter herbs ( marror ), the karpas , the shankbone and the egg and place them upon the three matzot - the shankbone which hints to kindness ( chesed ) on your right, the egg on your left; and the bitter herbs, which hint to harmony, 'extend from end to end' in the middle, between the shankbone and the egg.

Rather even the sages, the discerning ones and those who know the whole entire Torah must tell over the exodus from Egypt on that night.

And don't say that they were telling it to the students who did not know, but they rather sat by themselves. For when the dawn arose, the students came to them to inform them that the time of [reciting] the morning Shema had arrived. And it is like they said, ""until their students came, etc."" That is because this story is not the same for every person. Rather each one should recount the greatness of God and the ways of His wisdom that were revealed through the wonders that He did in Egypt, according to the power of his mind and his understanding; and according to the extent of his understanding and his knowledge of the ways of God, the images written in the Torah about the stories of the exodus from Egypt, the tradition of the fathers about these matters and the hidden wonders about them. And from this, you can understand the difference in the performance of this commandment between different people. And these differences branch out from the differences that we explained in (Chapter) 8 about the first commandments.",Not a great title.,

If the eulogy is delivered to honor the deceased, he is able to forgo this honor, but if it is delivered to honor the living, he is not, as it is not in the power of one individual to forgo the honor of others.

""You caused sentence to be heard from heaven"" refers to the revelation at Sinai. And why was the earth afraid? It is in accordance with the statement of Reish Lakish, as Reish Lakish said: What is the meaning of that which is written: ""And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day"" (Genesis 1:31)? Why do I require the superfluous letter heh , the definite article, which does not appear on any of the other days? It teaches that the Holy One, Blessed be He, established a condition with the act of Creation, and said to them: If Israel accepts the Torah on the sixth day of Sivan, you will exist; and if they do not accept it, I will return you to the primordial state of chaos and disorder. Therefore, the earth was afraid until the Torah was given to Israel, lest it be returned to a state of chaos. Once the Jewish people accepted the Torah, the earth was calmed.",,

But in the Gemara, it asked better than this - why do I need the coming that the [Torah] wrote about tefillin and the redemption of a donkey? And it answered that it is needed like for that which was taught by the House of Rabbi Yishmael, ""Do this commandment, so that you can enter the land on account of it."" Likewise must one explain the statement, ""When you come,"" that is said about the Passover sacrifice, the omer and the libations. As behold, Israel (the Jewish people) sacrificed the Passover sacrifice in the desert! And everyone holds that they also offered libations in the desert. And likewise is there one that says that also the prohibition of the new grain and the offering of the omer was practiced in the desert (see Kiddushin 37 and Tosafot, s.v. Hoyil). And according to this, the reading of the statement, ""When you come,"" that is said about the Passover sacrifice, the omer and the libations - is to say, ""Do this commandment, so that you can enter the land on account of it."" And regardless, regarding the commandments in the Temple - even though they come from produce of the Land [of Israel], the matter is only dependent on the existence of Israel in the land and it being a time when the Temple is standing. And it is like it is written about the law of the first fruits: Any time your have first fruits (see Mishneh Torah, First Fruits and Other Gifts to Priests 2:1, and Kessef Mishneh there). Hence it should not be learned about all the commandments that are dependent on the land that are not connected to the Temple - such as tithes and priestly tithes, orlah and seventh year produce - about which it stated, ""When you come,"" to make them obligated from the Torah (and not just rabbinically) even with the coming [back] of part of Israel.",,
