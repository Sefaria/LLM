There might be a scribal error in <b>Rav</b>’s commentary, which should read “35” instead of “95”. But it is possible that <b>Rav</b> simply intends to point out how complicated this can get, for which reason he quotes the opinion of Beit Shammai; rather than issuing a halachic ruling he is merely emphasizing the potential difficulty, even though the halacha does not follow that opinion. The conclusion of <b>Tosafot</b> there (30a, s.v. <i>sh’ma minah</i>), moreover, is that the halacha follows R. Yossi ben Yehuda who says that one immersion at the end suffices. If so, the halacha does not even follow the opinion of Beit Hillel.

It picks these areas to contrast them to astronomy and geometry, which also involve calculations [cf. below]—<b>Maharal</b> in <i>Derech Chaim</i>. He also writes that the mishna chooses these areas of law to make an additional point: even though these laws involve calculations that arise from cases of uncertainty, whereas astronomy and geometry involve no uncertainty, the laws are still more valuable.<br><b>Kesef Mishne</b> writes on Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah 4:13 that although bird-offerings seem to be a thing of little value and the beginnings of menstrual periods revolve around an unseemly subject, they are the main of the law on account of the great reward one receives for their study.

      "Tosafot Yom Tov on Pirkei Avot 3:18:6 - ASTRONOMY [Heb. <i>tekufot</i>]. <b>Rav</b>: <i>the movement of the constellations</i>. So also <b>Rashi</b>. Because they travel around [Heb. <i>makifim</i>] the world in a circular motion [Heb. <i>hekef</i>] their movement is called <i>tekufah</i>.<br>A variant text of <b>Rashi</b>’s commentary has: <i>the dimension of the sun’s orbit and when it switches quarters</i>. This is what the word <i>tekufah</i> means in the language of those who calculate the `<i>evron,</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">124</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Lit. “passing”. See notes below.</i> which is the point at which the sun passes from one quarter of its sphere to another,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">125</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In classical and medieval astronomy, the earth occupies the center of the universe. Surrounding it are several celestial spheres, containing different planets and stars, which revolve around the earth from east to west. The sun, by contrast, has its own celestial sphere which moves from west to east. In addition, while the other celestial spheres complete their orbits around the earth daily, the sun moves incrementally and only completes its orbit every 365 days. The position of the sun in its sphere is divided into four quarters, their starting points corresponding to the solstices and equinoxes, which rabbinic literature calls <i>tekufot</i>. The act of intercalation is called <i>`ibur</i>, a word of unclear etymology. Numerous medieval commentators unterstand it as deriving from the word <i>me`uberet</i>, “pregnant” in the Mishna and Talmud. <b>R. Avraham bar Chiyya</b>, the 11th-century philosopher, astronomer, and mathematician, offers an additional etymology based on <i>`avar</i>, the Biblical and Rabbinic Hebrew “passed”, explaining that the Sages take a month that has already passed and make it pass by again (<i>Sefer Ha`ibur</i>, ed. Filipowski, <i>Ma’amar Sheni, Sha`ar Shelishi</i>). Tosafot Yom Tov here offers a different etymology, making the verb <i>le`aber</i> a denominative deriving from the noun <i>`evron</i>, “a passing”, referring to the point at which the sun passes from one quarter of the sphere into the next. Tosafot Yom Tov seems to be conjecturing that the term was current in the Mishnaic and Talmudic periods, as it does not actually appear in Talmudic or subsequent astronomical literature. I have not made an exhaustive survey, but it appears that this etymology is original to Tosafot Yom Tov. </i> as <b>Rav </b>writes on the mishna in Sahnedrin 1:2 (s.v. <i>bishlosha</i>), that the court must intercalate [Heb. <i>me`abrin</i>] on account of the <i>tekufah.</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">126</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This connects <i>`ibur</i> to the <i>tekufah</i>.</i> Although leap years are now added based on a fixed formula and there is no longer a need for this, in the times of R. Eliezer Chisma they were still calculating the <i>tekufot</i> and detemining when to make a leap year based on their calculations, for this is what they did up until the days of Abaye and Rava, as <b>Rambam</b> writes in Hilchot Kiddush HaChodesh 5:3.<br>If we accept this explanation of the word <i>tekufot</i>, we must say that R. Eliezer Chisma’s dictum aplies only to the knowledge of the sun’s motion itself and not the legal ramifications thereof in the sanctification of the month and the making of a leap year; these are certainly both the main of the law. R. Eliezer Chisma was addressing himself only to those people that study these things simply to know them and be well-rounded scholars; to them R. Eliezer Chisma says these are merely side dishes.\n",

      "Tosafot Yom Tov on Pirkei Avot 3:18:7 - AND GIMATRIOT. <b>Rav</b>: <i>alphanumeric calculations</i>. Such as the midrash that the word Jacob said to his sons when he told them “go down (Heb. <i>r’du</i>, רדו) there” (Geneis 42:2) is a hint to the 210 years that Israel would spend in Egypt (Bereshit Rabbah 91:2). Or that the verse “with this (Heb. <i>bezot</i>, בזאת) shall Aharon enter the Sanctuary” (Leviticus 15:3) hints to the fact that the first Temple would stand 410 years. <b>Rashi</b> similarly explains <i>gimatriot</i> as alphanumeric calculations and the reading of a single word as an acronym. <b>Aruch</b> likewise writes: gimatriot<i>—writing א instead of 1, writing ק instead of 100</i>.<br>It seems to me that this is a loan-word from Greek, by which the Greeks call the science of measurement and arithmetic. Our Sages borrowed the word for all matters of calculation and number. So also the anonymous commentary on Hilchot Kiddush HaChodesh 18:13. I also saw that <b>Maharal</b> in <i>Derech Chaim</i> explains the word in our mishna as referring to the science of measurement and arithmetic.<br>If so, these are truly words that befit the one who said them: in the Talmud, Horayot 10a, R. Yehoshua testifies that R. Eliezer Chisma was able to estimate how many drops of water there are in the sea. This is through the discipline of engineering, for which measurement and arithmetic are prerequisites. It is because he had mastered all of these disciplines that it was proper for him to say this, as it would be improper for some other person who had not mastered these disciplines to speak this way, as the Sages say in Kohellet Rabbah 3:11. Therefore, this explanation of <i>gimatriot</i> as referring to measurement and arithmetic seems most likely. Cf. what I quote below from <b>Maggid Mishne</b>.<br>Now this discipline must chronologically precede astronomy, for without it a person dare not raise a finger in discussing the paths of the constellations and the hosts of the heavens. Even so, because of the importance of astronomy and its subject, the mishna places it before the chronologically earlier<i> gimatriot</i>.\n",

      "Tosafot Yom Tov on Pirkei Avot 3:18:8 - <i>PARPRA’OT</i> FOR WISDOM [Heb. <i>parpra’ot lechochma</i>]. <b>Rav</b>: <i>like the </i>parpra'ot <i>people eat at the end of a meal for pleasure for dessert, these disciplines give a person honor in peoples’ eyes.</i> If so, the Hebrew <i>lechochma</i>, which usually means “for wisdom”, means “of wisdom”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">127</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Honor comes from knowledge of these disciplines, and is therefore “of wisdom”. The simple reading would have the word <i>lechochma</i> mean “for wisdom”, implying that knowledge of these peripheral disciplines is somehow beneficial to the main body of wisdom which is Torah.</i> in our mishna. <b>Rashi</b>: <i>because they are only </i>parpra'ot<i>, i.e. matters of wisdom</i>.<br>The end of the <b>Kesef Mishne</b> I quoted above reads: <i>“for wisdom” means the wisdom of the Talmud which alone is worthy of being called “wisdom” without qualifiers, because it deals with G-d’s commandments and because of the great reward given to those who study it and keep its laws. These disciplines, therefore, are merely </i>parpra'ot <i>for it, for they are not the main thing the way it is</i>. My difficulty with this is that the first section of the mishna should then have said “these are the main of wisdom”.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">128</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If the “wisdom” referred to at the end of the mishna is the wisdom of the Talmud, the mishna’s contrast should have been between the main of “wisdom” and the side dishes thereof; there would be no reason to call it first law and then wisdom.</i><br>I found the <b>Maggid Mishne</b> on Hilchot G’nevah 8:1 giving the following explanation. <i>Tekufot</i> is arithmetic [Heb. <i>cheshbon</i>] per the the Talmud’s language “to be <i>choshev</i> the <i>tekufot</i>” (Shabbat 75a), <i>gimatri’ot</i> is the art of measurement, and “<i>parpra'ot </i>for wisdom” means for the discipline of astronomy, which is called <i>chochma</i> and <i>binah</i> in that same passage in Shabbat. This explanation also encounters difficulties, because <i>tekufot</i> certainly means the path of the stars and their orbit, not arithmetic. His proof from “to be <i>choshev</i> the <i>tekufot</i>” actually proves the exact opposite, that <i>tekufah</i> is not <i>cheshbon</i>!<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">129</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For if it were, the verb and its object would be redundant, along the lines of “calculating calculations”.</i> Also, how could the mishna call these <i>parpra'ot</i> when in fact they come before the meal? He must’ve understood <i>parpra'ot</i> to mean foods that come before the meal to create an appetite, as <b>Rav</b> explains the word in Berachot 6:5.<br>Now that we’ve mentioned that possibility, I say that <i>tekufot</i> refers to astronomy itself—the paths of the constellations and the whole host of the heavens. It, along with the geometry which precedes it, are appetizers that draw a person to that wisdom beyond which no greater wisdom lies for man: theology. For from a knowledge of the spheres of the heavens he will come to know the Creator, who is the one who “rides the heavens” (Deuteronomy 33:26)—from knowing what is ridden one comes to know the rider. Even according to the explanations of <b>Rashi</b> and <b>Rav</b> that <i>gimatriot</i> refers to alphanumerical calculations, we can say that “for wisdom” means “for theology,” because <i>Sefer Yetzirah</i> and similar works make extensive use of alphanumeric values, words read as acronyms, and permutations of the letters of a word. Based on this, we can also say that the tanna perhaps intended both things at the same time: <i>tekufot</i> are appetizers for human wisdom that can be attained through reasoning and investigation, and <i>gimatriot</i> are appetizers for our received theology.\n",

And since Rabbi Eliezer Chisma was after the destruction, etc., and the laws of <i>Kinin</i> are only applicable, etc.; therefore he needed to make us understand that even they are the body of the law - even at the time when the Temple does not exist, since their study is in place of the [Temple] service.

And it  is easy to accept this explanation, since Rabbi Eliezer Chisma knew how to approximate how many drops of water there are in the seas (as is found in Horayot 10a), etc. And therefore it was fit that he should say this, as is exemplified by their statement, may their memory be blessed, in the [Midrash] Rabbah at the beginning of Ecclesiastes. \n",

And so [too] according to the explanation of Rashi and Rabbi Bartenura that <i>Gematria</i> are the calculations of the letters, [it is that they are] \"condiments to the wisdom,\" of Divinity that is in Sefer Yetzirah and those similar to it, that greatly use calculations of the letters and acronyms and [other letter] combinations. And it is possible to say that the teacher intended both of them, which are: to the wisdom that is attained by analysis and research - and that is through astrological calculations; and to the wisdom of Divinity, which is passed on to us (Kabbalah).

      "Avot DeRabbi Natan 27:2 - Rabbi Papius would say: The congregation of Israel was favored above the horses in Pharaoh’s chariot, as it says, “You led your horses into the sea.”<br>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Karha would say: When Pharaoh went into the sea, he rode on a male horse. But then the Holy Blessed One revealed it to be a female horse, as it says (Song of Songs 1:9), “To a mare in Pharaoh’s chariots.” But was it perhaps not a chariot, but a cherub? As it says (Psalms 18:11), “He mounted a cherub and flew, gliding on the wings of the wind.” What happened is that the cherub appeared like a team of female horses, and they all went into the sea.<br>Those who scorn Me will not be taken seriously” – this is Sennacherib, who scorned the One who spoke and brought the world into being (thus scorning the Holy Blessed One), as it says (Isaiah 37:24–25), “Through your servants you have blasphemed my Lord. Because you said: Thanks to my vast chariotry, I have climbed the highest mountains to the remotest parts of the Lebanon, and have cut down its loftiest cedars, its choicest cypresses, and have reached its highest peak, its densest forest. I have drawn and drunk water. I have dried up all the streams of Egypt with the soles of my feet.” Therefore, the Holy Blessed One punished him through an emissary, who shaved his head and beard, and sent him back in shame to his own land.<br>(<i>Rabbi Yishmael the son of Rabbi Yohanan ben Beroka would say: One who learns in order to teach, etc.</i>) He would also say: You need not be ready to study the entire Torah, but neither are you free to leave it all aside. Rather, one who continues to add to his learning adds greatly to his reward.<br>Rabbi Elazar ben Hamsa would say: The study of bird offerings and the calculations of menstruation – these are the essence of the Law.<br>Rabbi Yohanan ben Nuri would say: Legal matters, ritual purity, bird offerings, and the calculations of menstruation – these are the essence of the Torah.<br>He would also say: Setting the [great] table, and establishing and supporting a court – both bring goodness into to the world.\n",

      "Rabbi Eliezer Hisma was a student of Rabban Gamaliel and of Rabbi Joshua.  Legend has it that he was a great mathematician.\n",
      "###\n",
      "English Explanation of Pirkei Avot 3:18:2 - <b>Rabbi Eliezer Hisma said:  the laws of mixed bird offerings and the key to the calculations of menstruation days these, these are the body of the halakhah. The calculation of the equinoxes and gematria are the desserts of wisdom.</b> Rabbi Eliezer Hisma states that there are two different types of laws that are “the body of the halakhah”.  This means that they are essential halakhot, paradigmatic of the Oral Torah.  The “laws of mixed bird offerings” refers to cases where one type of bird offering accidentally became mixed up with a different type.  For instance an obligatory offering became mixed up (perhaps in a net or in a dovecote) with a voluntary offering; or a sin offering became mixed up with a whole burnt offering.  There is a whole tractate entitled Kinnim that deals with these situations.   The second type of halakhah are the calculations of menstruation days.  This refers to calculating how many days there are between a woman’s cycle.  It is important to figure this out so that women can distinguish between menstrual bleeding and other types of bleeding.  Much of tractate Niddah is devoted to this subject. There are two types of laws that are only “desserts of wisdom”.  That is they help learning, but they are not essential.  One is astronomy, that is the calculation of the seasons.  The other is gematria, which refers to the adding up of numbers (obviously this is from the same word as geometry). According to the Meiri, Rabbi Eliezer Hisma wants to guide a person in his course of study.  The first thing a person should learn is Torah.  The two areas of Torah learning that he mentions are representative of some of the most difficult subjects in the learning of Torah.  A person should first learn Torah so well, that he is able to master even tractates Kinnim and Niddah.  Afterwards, when he has completely mastered even in these subjects, a person should turn his attention to science and mathematics, represented here by astronomy and geometry.\n",

      "Avot DeRabbi Natan 39:1 - Five kinds of people cannot be forgiven: One who constantly (again and again) sins; One who sins (in a righteous generation. One who sins) with the intent to repent. Anyone whose sin publicly desecrates God’s name. (A human being is incapable of grasping [God’s] likeness.) But if not for his sin, they would give him the keys, and he would know how heaven and earth were created. (He would also say: Everything is planned. Everything is revealed. Everything is knowable. He would also say: Everything is given in trust, and a net is spread out over all living things.) Repentance delays the judgment of the wicked, though their fate is already sealed. But the contentedness of the wicked ends badly. Power buries those who wield it. Repentance is suspended until Yom Kippur atones. Death (along with repentance) wipes clean. The wicked are paid, but the righteous accrue credit. The wicked are paid [in this world] – that is, the people who act as if they follow the Torah, but they have evil intentions, and there was never any good in them. The righteous accrue credit – that is, people who follow the Torah with good intentions, and there was never any bad in them. Both types receive just a little in this world, but [for the righteous,] a large remainder is accounted to them for the future. (He would also say: Everyone leaves this world naked; if only one’s leaving the world can be like one’s coming into the world!<br>Rabbi Meir would say: Beloved is the human being, who was created in the image of God, as it says (Genesis 9:6), “For in God’s image did God make the human.” Beloved are Israel, who are called children of the Omnipresent God, as it says (Deuteronomy 14:1), “You are children of the Eternal your God.” Beloved are Israel, for they were given a valuable tool. With it the world was created, as it says (Proverbs 4:2), “For I have given you a good thing; do not forsake My Torah.”)<br>Rabbi Eliezer bar Tzadok would say: What are the righteous like in this world? Like a tree that is planted in a pure place, but its branches extend out to an impure place. What do people say? Cut off that tree’s branches so that all of it will be pure, as it should be. What are the wicked like in this world? Like a tree that is planted in an impure place, but its branches extend out to a pure place. What do people say? Cut off that tree’s branches so that all of it will be impure, as it should be.\n",
