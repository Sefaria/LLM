Not all authorities agree with Rabbeinu Tam and the Rama. The author of the Shach (Gevurot Anashim 72, cited by Pitchei Teshuvah, E.H. 154:30) believes that these sanctions are coercive. The Chazon Ish (E.H. 108:12) rules in accordance with the Shachâ€™s strict view. On the other hand, the Aruch Hashulchan (E.H. 154:63) rules in accordance with Rabbeinu Tam and the Rama that these sanctions do not constitute coercion. This is also the view of Rav Bezalel Ashkenazi (Teshuvot 6 and 19), the Maharam Lublin (Teshuvot 1), the Eliah Rabbah (13), and Rav Yitzchak Herzog (Techukah Leyisrael Al Pi Hatorah 3:202,209 and Teshuvot Heichal Yitzchak E.H 1:1). It also seems to be the view of Rav Moshe Feinstein (Teshuvot Igrot Moshe, E.H. 1:137).
