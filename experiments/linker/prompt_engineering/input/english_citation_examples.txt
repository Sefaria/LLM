Anecdote and legend combine to illustrate Anan's renown for extreme conscientiousness in his capacity as judge in civil cases, as well as for his theosophic speculations. The books "$$Seder Eliyahu Rabbah$$" and "$$Seder Eliyahu Zutta$$," mysterious in more than one sense, are said to have been composed during visitations Anan received from the prophet Elijah ($$Ket. 106a$$). (See $$Tanna debe Eliyahu R.$$) But many of his teachings were probably incorporated with those of the students of the school that bore his name, Debe Rab Anan ($$Suk. 49b$$; $$Ber. 30b;$$ $$Shab. 119a$$; $$Yer. Shab. iii. 5c$$ (compare $$Bab. Shab. 37a$$); $$'Er. 74b$$; $$Yeb. 97a$$; $$Yer. Yeb. ix. 10b$$; $$Ket. 79a$$; $$Git. 44b$$; $$Shebu'ot, 40b$$; $$Hul. 4b, 38a, 56a$$). S. M.
Part II: $$Yoreh De'ah Chapter 1$$ – KOSHER AND UNKOSHER CREATURES The $$Torah$$ permits us to eat certain types of animals ($$Lev.11:2-8;$$ $$Deut.13:4-8$$), fish that have fins and scales ($$Lev.11:9-12$$; $$Deut.13:4-10$$), most types of birds ($$Lev.11:13-19$$; $$Deut.13:11-20$$), and some types of locusts ($$Lev.11:20-23$$). The $$Torah$$ gives two signs that distinguish the permissible (kosher) types of animals: they regurgitate and rechew their food and they have split hoofs; the oral $$Torah$$ gives additional signs ($$79:1$$). All other creatures that live in unconfined bodies of water are unkosher; drinking water should therefore be strained to remove small creatures from it (see $$Yerushalmi Peah Chapter 2 Halacha 3$$). The oral Torah gives signs that distinguish the kosher types of locusts, but today we eat them only if we have a reliable tradition that they are kosher ($$85:1$$). All other flying creatures (except for kosher birds) and land creatures (except for kosher animals) are unkosher; see $$84:4-7,15-16$$. Foods that are likely to be infested must therefore be inspected for the presence of small creatures or strained to remove them; see $$84:8-14$$ and $$100:4$$.

PARAPET (Heb. מעקה). Ancient roofs were flat and in general use (cf. $$Josh. 2:6$$; $$Judg. 16:27$$; $$I Sam. 9:25f$$; $$Isa. 22:1$$; et al.). The parapet must be not less than 10 handbreadths high and strong enough to keep a person who leans on it from falling ($$Sif. Deut. 229$$; $$Maim. Yad, Roẓe'aH 11:3$$). The law was given a far wider application, however, and made to include the need to remove any object that constitutes a public or a private hazard. Such precautions include fencing or covering a well or a pit ($$Maim. ibid., 11:4$$) and not keeping a savage dog or a shaky ladder in one's house ($$BK 15b$$).
The $$Torah$$ is a truth for all humanity, whether Jewish or not. The Jewish idea is that the $$Torah$$ of Moses is a truth for all humanity, whether Jewish or not. The $$Torah$$ (as explained in the $$Talmud - Sanhedrin 58b$$) presents seven mitzvot for non-Jews to observe. These seven laws are the pillars of human civilization, and are named the "Seven Laws of Noah," since all humans are descended from Noah. As well, when King Solomon built the Holy Temple in Jerusalem, he specifically asked God to heed the prayer of non-Jews who come to the Temple ($$1-Kings 8:41-43$$). In fact, the $$Talmud$$ says if the Romans would have realized how much they were benefiting from the Temple, they never would have destroyed it! Today, there are many active groups of non-Jews called "B'nai Noach" who faithfully observe the Seven Laws of Noah. There is an excellent book on the topic: "$$The Path of the Righteous Gentile$$" by Chaim Clorfene and Yakov Rogalsky See also: "$$The Real Messiah: A Jewish Response to Missionaries$$" by Aryeh Kaplan And: "$$The Rainbow Covenant$$" by Michael Dallen

Instead others should give him food for the seudat havrah.[1] Eating anything such as bread, meat, or vegetables is forbidden until the seudat havrah. However, he may have his own tea or coffee.[2] Some say that the Seudat Havrah should have meat. [3] A suedat havrah is done even on Chol Hamoed, Chanuka, Purim, and Rosh Chodesh for the relatives who are mourning.[4] There is no seudat havrah on Yom Tov even on Yom Tov Sheni.

Additionally, the Smag writes that everyone agrees that on Chanuka and Rosh Chodesh there is a seudat havrah. $$Shulchan Aruch YD 401:4$$ codifies the opinion of the Rosh and writes that there is a seudat havrah on Chol Hamoed, Chanuka, Rosh Chodesh, and also Purim. ↑ $$Shulchan Aruch YD 401:4$$. $$Rabbi Akiva Eiger on Shulchan Aruch$$ explains that even though according to Shulchan Aruch it is possible to have mourning on Yom Tov Sheni there is no seudat havrah since it is similar to a eulogy which isn't appropriate for Yom Tov, however, on Chol Hamoed when there is no mourning there is a seudat havrah as it isn't as emotional as a eulogy.

Leader of the Zealots (35-60, C.E.). When the Jews of Peræea had boundary disputes with the pagan population of Philadelphia, the procurator Fadus killed Annibas, one of the three leaders, and banished the other two, Amram and Eleazar. The latter may be identical with Eleazar b. Dinai. When Jewish pilgrims traversing Samaritan territory were killed by hostile Samaritans, the Jews in self-defense called Eleazar b. Dinai down from the mountains, and he ravaged Akrabatene.The procurator Felix succeeded by cunning in capturing Eleazar and his band, sending him in chains to Rome (Josephus, "$$Ant." xx. 1, § 1; 6, § 1; 8, § 5; "B. J." ii. 12, § 4; 13, § 2$$).Rabbinical sources also mention Eleazar. The $$Midrash to Cant. iii. 5$$ says that in the days of Amram and (Ben) Dinai the Jews prematurely attempted liberation. Mention is also made of a companion of Eleazar, Tehina ben Perisha by name, probably the Alexander mentioned by Josephus. Through the example of these two men murders became so frequent that the sacrifice of atonement for an unknown murderer ($$Deut. xxi. 1-8$$) was abolished ($$Sotah ix. 9$$; $$Tosef. xiv. 1$$; $$Bab. 47b$$; $$Yer. 24a$$; $$Sifre, Deut. 205$$). The wife of Eleazar b. Dinai is also mentioned ($$Ket. 27a$$).Bibliography: Grätz, Gesch. 4th ed., iii. 431, 436; Schürer, Gesch. 3d ed., i. 570; Büchler, Das Grosse Synedrion in Jerusalem, p. 143, Vienna, 1902.G. S. Kr.
The $$Talmud (Shabbat 12b$$, $$Sotah 33a$$) states that one should not pray for his needs in Aramaic, as the ministering angels will be unhelpful, as they do not understand Aramaic. Tosafot question how this is possible, considering the fact that they know even the thoughts of men. The Ra'avad ($$T'mim Deim 184$$, cited in $$Gilyon HaShas$$) understands the $$Talmud's$$ statement somewhat differently, interpreting that the angels will not pay attention to the prayer to bring it before G-d. The S'dei Chemed ($$ma'arekhet ha-mem, klal 202$$) cites the Chida as assuming that angels do not know the thoughts of humans, and thus explains the principle that sinful intent is not counted as action: G-d Himself will not testify against His children, and the Heavenly Beit Din [of angels] is unaware of thoughts [compare $$Maharsha, Sanhedrin 92b$$, that accusing angels do not speak Aramaic, but defending angels speak all languages]. The S'dei Chemed questions this opinion because of Tosafot, but concludes, against Tosafot, that only G-d knows the thoughts of man. Further, the S'dei Chemed quotes two opinions as to whether angels know the future. The Klausenberger Rebbe ($$Resp. Divrei Yatziv, Y.D. 121:5$$) discusses the question of whether any obligation exists to follow the commands of an angel. He assumes that this is dependent on the question of whether angels are on a higher level than tzadikim, or vice versa. He concludes that this point varies, depending on the angel and on the individual.
[20]. See $$Shabbat 23a$$; $$sa 677:1$$. According to Ashkenazic custom, every member of the household lights his own candles, in order to beautify the mitzva. In contrast, according to Sephardic custom (above $$12:3$$), only one person lights in each household. According to $$Ginat Veradim$$ (cited in $$Kaf Ha-ĥayim 677:3$$), as long as the guests are completely dependent on their hosts, there is no need to pay the value of a pruta toward the cost of the candles, because we can assume the hosts give them a share in the candles as a gift. However, according to many Aĥaronim, including $$mb 677:1$$, the guests should still contribute the value of a pruta or otherwise acquire a share in the candles. The only case in which they do not need to do so is if they are permanently dependent on the host, as is the case with live-in workers. Even if the guest is one of the homeowner's children, and thus there is good reason to claim that he is considered a part of the family, since the guest is an independent adult, it is proper for him to pay toward the cost of the candles and meet the requirements of the more stringent position on the matter.
Taking care of one's needs before tefillah puts his personal needs before those of Hashem. A mitzvah is done for Hashem's honor and does not fall under this prohibition. Therefore, the halachah is that chafatzecha (your needs) are forbidden, but cheftzei Shamayim (heavenly needs) are permitted before one prays ($$Mishnah Berurah 250,1$$). One example of cheftzei Shamayim is collecting tzedakah. In the morning, most people are gathered together in shul, and it is a good time to approach people. One may collect before praying especially when the case is pressing ($$Mishnah Berurah 89,36$$). The halachah states that a person should give tzedakah before praying ($$Shulchan Aruch 92,10$$). This halachah is not limited to contributing one's money to a good cause. Giving of one's time and energy is also tzedakah, and therefore one can perform acts of kindness to others in the morning before tefillah (Rav Shlomo Zalman Aeurbach as cited in $$Halichos Shlomo 2,8$$). Chazal tell us that the tefillos of Yom Tov should start later than usual. While on a simple level this allows one to get more rest, halachic authorities add that the extra time allows one to take care of Yom Tov needs before prayer. Since these are cheftzei Shamayim they are permitted before tefillah ($$Mishnah Berurah 529,14$$). Text Copyright © 2013 by Rabbi Daniel Travis and Torah.org
As mentioned in yesterday's Halacha Yomis, there is no requirement to recite Kiddush before davening as the obligation to recite Kiddush only begins after davening when one is permitted to eat the Shabbos meal. There are two opinions among Rishonim whether a woman is required to daven Shacharis every day, or is it sufficient for her to recite a short prayer (see $$Mishna Berura 106:4$$). $$Shemiras Shabbos K'hilchosa (52:13$$) writes that if a woman does not daven Shacharis, but recites a short prayer in the morning, the short prayer is equivalent to davening Shacharis vis-a-vis the requirement to recite Kiddush. Once she has said her short prayer, she is obligated to recite Kiddush, and may no longer eat or drink until she has fulfilled the requirement of Kiddush. If a woman is feeling weak and does not have grape juice available, some poskim are lenient to allow her to eat in the morning before hearing Kiddush. ($$Teshuvas Minchas Yitzchok 4:28(3$$)). This is because some Rishonim exempt a woman from Kiddush Shabbos during the day. Though we do not normally follow this view, we can rely on it in situations of necessity. Rav Moshe Feinstein, zt"l is of the opinion that a married woman is not obligated to recite Kiddush before her husband has davened. ($$Igros Moshe, volume 4, 101:2$$). Accordingly, if a woman has completed her morning prayers before her husband has davened, she may eat a full meal. $$Shemira Shabbos Kehilchosa (52:46$$) notes, that Rav Shlomo Zalman Auerbach, zt"l disagreed with Rav Moshe, zt"l on this latter point.

You shall return the collateral to him… ($$Deuteronomy 24:13$$)  It is discussed in the $$Talmud in tractate Baba Metzia (113a-b$$) and codified in the $$Shulchan Aruch in Choshen Mishpat 97$$. This mitzvah is #199 of the 248 positive mitzvos in the Rambam's $$Sefer HaMitzvos$$ and #63 of the 77 positive mitzvos that can be observed today as listed in the Chofetz Chaim's $$Sefer HaMitzvos HaKatzar$$.
$$Rashi Bereshis 2 Pasuk 3$$ says that even those things that were to be found but whose abundance was greatly lessened were also mentioned, as it is written ($$Sotah 48b$$) "From the day that the First Temple was destroyed song and fine silk were abolished " and see $$Tosafot (Shabbat 20b Anan$$) but in any case they are (ie. song and fine silk) to be found, they are somewhat commonplace, see there. Also white glass is mentioned there, and see $$Rashi (Baba Metzia 29b B'Zchuchit$$) but nonetheless they are still somewhat commonplace, see there. As so too, the flowing honeydew as is mentioned in $$tractate Sotah (ibid$$) that it ceased. And yet in the $$Jerusalem Talmud (Peah, chapter 7 law 3$$) it seems that it was also found after the destruction. And if indeed the "Techelet" was hidden and ceased to be, the $$Talmud$$ would certainly have mentioned it in this connection. And in any case, would not have failed to let us know about this anywhere in the $$Talmud$$. And from this it seems clear that it was not hidden, nor did it cease to exist and to this we need not even give a thought; for at no time was its existence changed, and it was always difficult to obtain, as $$tractate Menachot$$ points out ($$43a$$) "And it was sold dearly," see there. Also an expert and artisan, one proficient in the making of the dye, was also needed, as is implied there ($$Menachot ibid$$). And now too after the destruction of the Temple, its acquisition is no more expensive than during the time of the Temple. And its location is ascertainable with Blessed Divine Help, through an expertly skilled artisan.
$$Kitzur Shulchan Aruch 79:5$$. * Rabba and Rav Yosef in $$Gemara Gittin 60a$$ state that one can't read from a Sefer Haftorot since it isn't supposed to be written since it isn't a complete Sefer of Tanach. However, the Gemara concludes that it is permitted since it is otherwise impossible for every congregation to have a complete set of Navi klafim handwritten. Why shouldn't you read it if it isn't shouldn't be written? The Meiri seems that once the rabbis said it was forbidden to write they also didn't want people to read from it once it was written. However, the $$Ritva Gittin 60a$$ explains that since the incomplete sefer shouldn't be written reading from it is like reading pesukim by heart, which is forbidden. Similarly, the $$Chatom Sofer O.C. 1:68$$ explains that reading from an incomplete sefer is forbidden just like reading by heart since both of them are forms of transmitting Torah that could lead to mistakes. According to that approach, assuming like $$Tosfot Temurah 14b s.v. devarim$$ it is forbidden to read from an incomplete sefer for others. $$Tosfot Temurah$$ holds that one could read pesukim by heart for oneself but not to exempt others. $$Gra 49:2$$ holds that opinion is correct. $$Magen Avraham 49:1$$ is concerned for that opinion. Accordingly, Chatom Sofer concludes that if they are reading the haftorah from an incomplete sefer the congregation should read to themselves. Gra in $$Maaseh Rav n. 136$$ and $$Mishna Brurah 284:11$$ agree with that logic. * The Ritva and Meiri write that the halacha is that it is permitted to write an incomplete sefer because of Et Laasot LaHashem. $$Kol Bo siman 20$$ quotes the Rashba who writes that one can read the haftorah from an incomplete sefer. $$Bet Yosef 284:1$$ quotes this. * $$Magen Avraham 284:5$$ quotes the Arizal who said that a person should read the haftorah to oneself and listen to the brachot. $$Pri Megadim E"A 284:5$$ points out that everyone should read along quietly and listen to the congregational reading otherwise if no one listens to the congregational reading and just reads silently it isn't a reading of a tzibur. $$Maaseh Rav n. 136$$ also makes it clear that one should read word by word with the Shaliach Tzibur.
$$Shevet Halevi 2:158:3$$, $$Kinyan Torah 2:58$$ and $$Chovat Hadar 9:3$$ write that women can put them up even ideally. Rav Hershel Schachter ($$Be'ikvei HaTzon p. 9$$) writes that the halacha follows the opinion that says women may put up mezuzot. $$Beer Moshe 2:100$$ and $$6:79:5$$ as well as $$Teshuvot Vihanhagot 4:238:6$$ write that it is ideal for a man to put up the mezuzot, however, if a women did put them up, it need not be removed.
$$Rama Y.D. 291:2$$. $$Birkei Yosef 291:4$$ notes that the Rabbenu Manoach, the source for the Rama, wrote that it is good for the new tenant to pay for the mezuzot but they don't have to. However, the language of the $$Rama 291:2$$ is that it is required.
