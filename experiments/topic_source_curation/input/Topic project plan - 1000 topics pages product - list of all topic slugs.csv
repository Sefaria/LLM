In less halakhic or more theoretical topics (giving, kindness, biblical characters), I thought the AI's flowery language/fluffiness and occasional delusional language to be really fine or passable for the most part. In a topic like this, it really just felt like the AI was spewing things it did not understand. It would also throw around terms like ""demai""and ""bikkurim"" and ""dinarim"" without defining them, or say things like ""If you need to exchange money from the redemption of the second tithe for golden dinarim, you can do so without adding a fifth,"" without ever explaining how the process of exchanging works or that one generally does need to add a fifth (and what that means). This is all to say that in addition to the incoherent fluffiness and spewing, I don't think this page will be particularly accessible to a newcomer. ",transliteration inconsistencies,
